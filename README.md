# B–Series Web Application Distribution

The B-Series is a system for rapidly building solid custom web applications. It is powered by the [li₃ PHP framework](http://li3.me/) and licensed under the permissive free BSD 3-clause software license.

This distribution includes its overarching directory layout, an example starting application, and very useful tools to manage the lifecycle of a software project. It is the basis for your own projects and the starting point for anyone interested in the B-Series.
